# Collections

This collection hierarchy is freely and loosely inspired by the Java util data structure.

## Trie

It's a data structure used for retrieving any sequence of symbols (e.g. strings, binary bits, ASCII characters, etc.), also known as Digital Tree or Prefix Tree. It's name derives from the word re-TRIE-val.

It allows us to efficiently check whether or not a particular sequence is in the dictionary.

Insert, delete and search are fast

Printing the strings stored in the Trie is achievable by using a Depth-first search of the tree.

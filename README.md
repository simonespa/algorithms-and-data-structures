# Algorithms & Data structures

This repo is an open source collection and playground of algorithms, data structures and related documentation to brush up your knowledge of computer science fundamentals, or learn it from scratch.

## How to use it

Install all dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

To play around with the data structures and algorithms and create your own stuff, run TS in watch mode in order to get incremental compilation errors while you code

```
pnpm dev
```

You can run a TS script

```
pnpm start <path/to/the/file.ts>
```

You can also write tests and run the entire suite once

```
pnpm test
```

or run it in watch mode

```
pnpm test:watch
```

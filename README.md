# Algorithms & Data structures

This repo is an open source collection and playground of algorithms, data structures, coding exercises and related documentation to brush up your knowledge of computer science fundamentals.

## Get started

Initialise the repository

```
pnpm install
```

To play around with the data structures and algorithms and create your own stuff, run TS in watch mode in order to get incremental compilation errors while you code

```
pnpm dev
```

You can run a TS script

```
pnpm start <path/to/the/file.ts>
```

You can also write tests and run the entire suite once

```
pnpm test
```

or run it in watch mode

```
pnpm test:watch
```

# Algorithms & Data structures

[![CodeQL Advanced](https://github.com/simonespa/algorithms-and-data-structures/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/simonespa/algorithms-and-data-structures/actions/workflows/codeql.yml) | [![Dependabot Updates](https://github.com/simonespa/algorithms-and-data-structures/actions/workflows/dependabot/dependabot-updates/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/simonespa/algorithms-and-data-structures/actions/workflows/dependabot/dependabot-updates)

This repo is an open source collection and playground of algorithms, data structures, coding exercises and related documentation to brush up your knowledge of computer science fundamentals.

## Get started

Initialise the repository

```
pnpm install
```

To play around with the data structures and algorithms and create your own stuff, run TS in watch mode in order to get incremental compilation errors while you code

```
pnpm dev
```

You can run a TS script

```
pnpm start <path/to/the/file.ts>
```

You can also write tests and run the entire suite once

```
pnpm test
```

or run it in watch mode

```
pnpm test:watch
```

## Test coverage
